## Questions
1. Discuss a case study for using a technology such as XML or JSON.
The similarity between XML and JSON is that they are both formats for storing
and exchanging data, but ultimately both platforms have specific use cases and
characteristics. XML is more verbose and supports a wide range of data types
and validation features, making it suitable for complex documents and
enterprise applications where data integrity and schema validation are
critical. XML also allows for improve search efficiency. <br>
JSON on the other hand, is more lightweight and commonly use in web apps due to
its ease of use and compatibility with JScript. JSON is beneficial for APIs and
webs services where simplicity and speed are critical. JSON has become a
popular format for transmitting data between a client and server because it's
easy to parse and generate.

2. Which do you prefer: XML or JSON? And why? 
I prefer JSON over XML because of its simplicity, conciseness, and ease of
use to work and integrate with inside an html or any other platform - which
has proven to help with web development workflow. While XML is powerful, I find
it more verbose. Thus for overall practicality, I would choose JSON.
